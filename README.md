##Description of Design Used

All the Contents of the web page were contained using the Bootstrap container class. All the Images were also given a class of Image fluid, so as to make them responsive.

###NavBar

- First of, using the navbar design template got from the bootstap 5 documentation, I design the navbar including features such as Navbrand, and nav items. I used a design theme of Navbar-light to get a slightly grey background theme and dark text. The NavBar items were aligned to the right using margin start auto.

##Hero Section

- For the Hero section, I aligned the text content in the main div using the align center property. For the button in this section, an hover effect was used to add additional styling on it.

##Product Section

- Moving to the Product section, I used the bootstrap grid layout through the use of Rows and Columns. Two row were used and eight columns of equal width were generated from them both. Inside of each column, a Bootstrap card layout was used to design a Card, that had an Image, a Title, a description and button, all included inside the card body except the Image, which was added on the Card Body.

##Review Section

- For the Review Section, I used a text center class to center all of its contents. For the image content, a rounded circle class was used to get a Circle Image.
